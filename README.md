The unit is selected by pressing u and selecting it from the menu. Right click to see a pop menu of actions for that unit.
There are various different actions depending on what you right click on. To see info about a building unit or resource right click
on it and select info.

Notes:
* If you leave it running for a long time (hours?) the units will run out of food and they will all starve.
* The construction action was never completed. You can finish building the unfinished building on the map, but you can't start any new constructions.
* There are bugs that I didn't get around to fixing. Just restart the game.
