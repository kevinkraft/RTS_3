I'm writting this game again with the Unity engine, you can see what I've done so far, here: https://github.com/kevinkraft/RTS_4

I've already gotten further than I had on this version (RTS_3). The UI on this game took lots of time to debug and fix. Now that I'm using Unity it's much easier to make good UIs and development time is much shorter.

Controls:
-----------

f) toggle fullscreen

u) select unit (a devoloper tool)

s) toggle scroll and zoom on/off

esc) quit

wasd) move camera, or move mouse to edge of screen

mouse wheel) zoom

g) toggle grid

c) toggle cursor

The unit is selected by pressing u and selecting it from the menu. Right click to see a pop menu of actions for that unit.
There are various different actions depending on what you right click on. To see info about a building unit or resource right click
on it and select info.

Notes:
* If you leave it running for a long time (hours?) the units will run out of food and they will all starve.
* The construction action was never completed. You can finish building the unfinished building on the map, but you can't start any new constructions.
* There are bugs that I didn't get around to fixing. Just restart the game.
* The NumberBox in the ExchangeMenu isn't working correctly. The selected number in the box isn't passed to the ExchangeMenu. It used to work, so it's probably an easy fix.
